# `easy-dotfiles-private`

This README file should end up on the root of your `easy-dotfiles-private` git repository. The contents of the private repo are stored on your local installation at this path:

```sh
cd ~/easy-dotfiles/private/ && ls -l
```

Your private `easy-dotfiles` repo is having a predefined structure:

- [`config`](./config/) - This is where all of your configuration `json` files are stored.
- [`data`](./data/) - The content of this folder is automatically handled by **`easy-dotfiles`**. Here you can check what files or dconf settings are exported.
- [`scripts`](./scripts/) - Home of the defaults and distro specific setup scripts. Here you can put your custom scripts, if needed.

Please consult the **`easy-dotfiles`** docs for more details on how you can configure and use this awesome tool.
